## Course Description

This course is a project lead training program for learning application development using C# as a language. During the course, trainees will learn language basics, unit testing techniques, design and application development best practices and much more. All trainees of this program will be assigned mentors who will be responsible for working with the trainee throughout the duration of the program.

## Prerequisites
* Understanding and knowledge of using git and Github.
* Access to Tavisca training resources on pluralsight.
* Access to collaboration tools, mentor assignments and office-hour schedules.

These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts. If you need a refresher, take a look at the [Beginner Materials](initial/README.md).

## Course Overview

We will dive into the nuances of C# language, features and capabilities of the .NET framework, and how it can be used to build complex applications. The focus of this course is to provide the foundational knowledge of .net framework and C# language. Subsequent courses will leverage this background for their trainings on higher level frameworks and techniques. Some of the topics to be covered in this training include -

* C# language syntax and programming constructs
* Unit testing and continous integration
* Object oriented modelling and programming techniques
* Application development

## Homework/Projects

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### Workflow

As we are going to be using Github throughout the duration of this course, it is extremely important that all trainees are well versed with git. You can find resources on how to get started with git [here](initial/learning-git.md).
If you're using GitHub Desktop, these general instructions will help:

* <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/>

## How to submit assignments
The course will be divided into core themes, where each theme will have a set of programming assignments. These assignments will be updated regularly on this page as the training progresses. Each assignment will have relevant self-study reference material, an the initial code repository for the assignment and a sumbission date by which the assignment is to be completed.
Each trainee should follow the steps below for each assignment -
1. Study the provided self study material to learn the concepts required for the assignment.
2. Fork the assignment repository into your Github account.
3. Solve the assignment and commit source code into your forked repository.
4. Submit PR to the original repository tagging your mentor for review and sign-off.
5. Review feedback from mentors need to be incorporated before your submission will be accepted.

Please feel free to reach out to your mentors incase you are blocked on anything or have any questions.
