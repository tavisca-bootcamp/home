## Course Description

Learn best practices in JavaScript in this intensive, five-session course. Topics include data encapsulation, closures, binding, inheritance, and name spacing. Discover some of the lesser-known, yet useful, features of the language, such as how to debug JavaScript problems on different browsers and improve performance. Create interactive webpages using third-party JavaScript libraries.

Computers are provided in the lab, though you are encouraged to bring a laptop for in-class exercises.

## Prerequisites
* Understanding and knowledge of using git and Github.
* Access to Tavisca training resources on pluralsight.
* Access to collaboration tools, mentor assignments and office-hour schedules.

These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts. If you need a refresher, take a look at the [Beginner Materials](initial/README.md).

## Course Overview

We will dive into the nuances of C#, how prototypal inheritance compares to classical inheritance, and how this can be used to build dynamic and complex web applications.  Modern tools like jQuery and BackboneJS will be discussed, but students will learn the building blocks of these frameworks and after this course be able to understand what is happening under the hood.  The focus will be on development for browsers, though most applies to other systems like Node.js, Phonegap, etc.  Topics covered include:

* Encapsulation, closures and scope
* Classical vs. prototypal inheritance
* The event loop
* AJAX and JSONP
    * local
    * remote (e.g. Foursquare)
* Creating MVC-style models (a'la Backbone.js) from scratch
* Test- and Pseudocode-Driven Development

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides, available at [advanced-js.github.io/deck](http://advanced-js.github.io/deck/).  Additional exercises will completed in-class.

See [this interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20140306162909/http://blog.masterstreet.com/2013/09/05/interview-with-aidan-feldman-instructor-at-nyu-scps/) for more background.

## Homework/Projects

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### Workflow

If you're using GitHub Desktop, these general instructions will help:

* <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>
* <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/>

Enabling `Edit`->`Automatically Sync after Committing` is recommended. Here are the steps:

1. Fork the repository for the exercise/project (found under [github.com/advanced-js](https://github.com/advanced-js)).
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser and open the Developer Tools.
1. Modify the files to complete your solution.
1. Refresh the `index.html` page to see the results, and repeat.
1. Make sure all of your code is committed.
1. Push/sync up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository. All assignments are due at the start of the following class, unless otherwise specified.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (listed in Classes) – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.

When the pull request is created, you should see a message saying that "the Travis CI build is in progress" – this means that your solution is being automatically checked for syntax errors.  If this "build" ends up failing (which will show a red "X"), click through the "details" link and scroll to the bottom to see what the errors were.  Per the [requirements](#requirements) below, please fix the issues and push up the changes.

Feedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions!  You are welcome to open the pull request early as a work-in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question.  Note that your solution will also be live at `http://USERNAME.github.io/EXERCISE`.

#### Versions

For exercises with multiple Versions (`V1`, `V2`, etc.) listed in the README: these are intended as guidelines for how to complete the assignments in the smallest/simplest possible increments.  You are expected to reach the highest Version for each assignment by the due date. See also: [extra credit](#extra-credit).

### Requirements

These apply to real life, as well.

* [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) build should pass, which includes:
    * All HTML files should pass [W3C Markup Validation](http://validator.w3.org).
    * All written JS should pass [JSHint](http://jshint.com).
* Must apply "good programming style" learned in class
    * Functions should be "short" (see [Sandi Metz's rules for developers](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)).
    * Optimize for readability.
        * ["Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." -Harold Abelson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9168-programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-only)
    * Avoid using anonymous callbacks within other functions, especially if the callback is more than one or two lines.
    * For projects, use Object-Oriented Programming.
* Any borrowed code must be properly [annotated](#instructor).

#### Extra Credit

Bonus points for:

* Automated tests
* Creativity (as long as requirements are fulfilled)
* Anything listed under `BONUS` in the README of the exercise.

## Statements on Plagiarism

### SCPS

> New York University takes plagiarism very seriously and regards it as a form of fraud.  The definition of plagiarism that has been adopted by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies is as follows: "Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as though it were one's own.  More specifically, plagiarism is to present as one's own words quoted without quotation marks from another writer; a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work; or facts or ideas gathered, organized, and reported by someone else, orally and/or in writing.  Since plagiarism is a matter of fact, not of the student's intention, it is crucial that acknowledgement of the sources be accurate and complete.  Even where there is not a conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism.  Penalties for plagiarism range from failure for a paper or course to dismissal from the University.

### Instructor

Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern software development.  As a professional programmer you will never write anything from scratch.  This class is structured such that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers.  I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they  are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find, and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
