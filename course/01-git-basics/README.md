# Git Basics

## 1. Create your Tavisca Github accounts
Create a new github account for use in Tavisca. We will be using this account for all training assignments moving forward. This account will also be used on your projects inside Tavisca post training. A couple of things to note for this account.
* Username for this account should be `tavisca-<your tavisca.in username>`. E.g., if your username is jdoe@tavisca.in, then the username should be tavisca-jdoe.
* Use your tavisca.in email address as your email address for the github account.
* Incase the requested username is taken, adjust the username for uniqueness appropriately.
