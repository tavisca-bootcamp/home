# Learning git
The links below provide details on training video, reading, and hands-on lab content for learning git. As we use Github as our git version control system, some of the content below also details how to use Github as part of a typical development practice.

## Video training content for learning git
1. [Git Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/git-fundamentals/table-of-contents) - In this course, learn how to create a local repository, commit files, push changes to a remote repository, fix errors in your commits, and many of Git's other features. Understand the difference between the working copy, staging area, and repository itself. Come learn the power of Git.

2. [Mastering Git](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/mastering-git/table-of-contents) - In this course, Mastering Git, you'll tackle the more advanced Git topics, focus on how to actually get stuff done with Git, and will also learn the Git way of thinking so that you can work comfortably with Git day in and day out. First, you'll discover how to use Git fluently in your daily job. Next, you'll be taught how to move information around in Git and how to investigate and change your history in Git. Then, you'll move on to fixing any mistakes that you make while working with Git. Finally, you'll explore how to organize a shared Git workflow for your team. 

3. [How git works](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/how-git-works/table-of-contents) - This course teaches how the git version control system works under the covers.

4. [Using Gitflow](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/using-gitflow/table-of-contents) - This course teaches the details of a version control workflow called Gitflow which is quite popular with teams using git. GitFlow is a set of rules that gives users of Git a set of "best practices" to use when using Git. The set rules govern how to setup Git branches, which branches to have, when to create feature branches, when and what to tag, and when to merge and to which branch. The idea being that with a set of rules to follow using any source control system becomes easier. GitFlow doesn't add anything new to established workflows such as the "feature branch workflow." What it does, though, is to give specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. The workflow uses feature branches as well as individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases. You also get the benefits of the feature branch workflow such as pull requests and more efficient collaboration.
